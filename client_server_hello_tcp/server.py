# What is Socket Programming?
# Itâ€™s a way to allow programs to communicate over a network (either local or internet) using a programming interface called a socket.

# Types of Sockets:

# TCP (SOCK_STREAM): Connection-oriented, reliable, ordered.

# UDP (SOCK_DGRAM): Connectionless, faster, unreliable.

# socket(): Create a socket.

# bind(): Bind socket to IP & Port.

# listen(): Listen for incoming connections.

# accept(): Accept connection.

# connect(): Client requests connection.

# send(): Send data.

# recv(): Receive data.

# close(): Close connection.
