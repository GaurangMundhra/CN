// A Sliding Window Protocol is a method of flow control in computer networks where:

// Both sender and receiver have a "window" of frames they can send/receive at a time.

// The window size determines how many frames can be sent without waiting for an acknowledgment.

// The window slides forward as acknowledgments are received.

// Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) is an error control protocol used in data transmission:

// The sender sends multiple frames at a time (window-based)

// The receiver acknowledges each correctly received frame individually

// If any frame is lost or corrupted, only that specific frame is resent, not the entire window (unlike Go-Back-N ARQ)
